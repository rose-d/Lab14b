# Lab14b
The Lab14bvst.java starting program displays a complete Choo-Choo train, shown below.  The object of this lab assignment is not to display some type of different train, but the exact same train you saw in Chapter XIV.  You are expected to take the existing classes and rewrite both classes and methods to develop a program that meets proper Object Oriented Programming standards.
